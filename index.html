          <h1>Hi , I am Adam <span>an aspiring Junior Developer</span></h1>
          <p>
            I have been interested in becoming a Front end developer for the
            last 2 years, firstly trying the self taught route currently more
            than half way through a boot camp. I love building things on the web
            and seeing it happen in real time, i have always been a problem
            solver and since finding developing i get to practice it everyday.

        <p>
          iRecipe is a recipe and cocktail recipe generator, that allows user to
          search for a recipe by inputting a meal or ingredient. This project
          was my first time collaborating with other developers so i learnt a
          lot. I was tasked with writing the functionality in javascript using 2
          third party apis. I also implemented a like button feature that saves
          its state even on refresh using local storage. The technology used in
          this webpage is as follows. Bootstrap, CSS , javascript, Git.

          <p>
            This work day planner was an assignment given to me by my boot camp,
            with the criteria of using bootstrap, moment js and local storage.
            The user wanted a planner based on a 8 hour work day that is color
            coordinated based on past , present and future. With the capability
            of entering text into different hour slots with the ability to save
            even on refresh. During this assignment i learnt a lot about local
            storage and receiving saved information on page load as well as
            using if statements to test specific conditions. Created using
            Bootstrap, CSS and javascript.
